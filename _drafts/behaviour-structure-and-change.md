title: Behaviour, Structure, and Change
---
This post is the first on a series aimed to explain software development to people without a software development background.

## Observable Behaviour

Software is valuable because of what it does, or in other words because of how it *behaves*. Its behaviour only exists to the extent that it can be observed; much like the tree in the middle of the forest, far away from anyone who could hear it falling, behaviour that cannot be observed in any way cannot actually be considered as such.

Far from being a trait exclusive of software, observable behaviour is rather something that we find in every manufactured product and service. Some examples:

- A moving car changes direction when its steering wheel is turned;
- The interior of a house remains  

It's worth noting that the observable behaviour tautology is *subjective* by definition, as different observers interacting with the software from different points of view will actually perceive different sets of behaviour.

It's also worth noting that observable behaviour is *fractal*,

## Internal Structure

Behaviour cannot exist on its own.
